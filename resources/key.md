## Key for Metadata Element Entries

Full information for each TEST study metadata element includes the following fields:

- **Description:** A short description of the metadata element and the information it is intended to convey.
- **Required:** Indicates whether the metadata element is mandatory ("Yes") or optional ("No"). Required elements must include at least one value.
- **Repeatable:** Indicates whether the metadata element may be repeated ("Yes") or if it may only occur once ("No").
- **Accepted values:** The type of values that may be used with the metadata element; options include text (with additional requirements, such as date formatting, noted when present) and numbers. Multi-part metadata elements have accepted value information provided in entries for individual subelements.
- **Controlled Vocabulary:** Indicates the specific controlled vocabulary (i.e., a set of standardized terms) that must be used to provide values for the metadata element ('N/A' indicates no controlled vocabulary is required). 
- **Usage Notes:** Additional information about the nature, scope, and conventions for values that may be added to the metadata element.  
- **TEST Input Guidance:** Information for TEST staff related to using internal tools and resources to create and input metadata values. These notes are made available to the general TEST community for transparency.  
- **Examples:** Examples of valid values for the metadata element.
