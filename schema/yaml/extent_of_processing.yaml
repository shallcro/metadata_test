    Local TEST controlled vocabulary. See below for terms and definitions:

    | *Term* | *Definition* |
    |----------|---------------|
    | Checked for undocumented or out-of-date codes | Selected if the TEST curator checked at least half of the variables in the data collection for wild codes and corrected or reported in the codebook any wild codes discovered by these checks. |
    | Created online analysis version with question text | Selected if the TEST curator created online analysis version with question text. |
    | Created variable labels and/or value labels | Selected if the TEST curator created variable labels and/or value labels. |
    | Performed consistency checks | Selected if the TEST curator performed any of the following consistency checks on at least half of the variables in the data collection and corrected or reported in the codebook any inconsistencies discovered by these checks:<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- Checked to see that skip patterns in questionnaires were followed correctly.  <br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- Checked the logical consistency of response patterns across variables. |
    | Performed recodes and/or calculated derived variables | Selected if the TEST curator recoded at least one original variable in the data collection and/or produced at least one new variable derived from one or more original variables. The following kinds of recodes DO NOT qualify for this task:<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- Recodes performed for reasons of confidentiality. This type of recoding may be mentioned in other sections of the metadata description, usually in Restrictions or Collection Notes.  <br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- Recodes performed to correct errors uncovered by consistency checks.  <br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- Recodes performed to correct errors uncovered by checks for undocumented codes.  <br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- Recodes performed by standardized missing data codes.  <br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- When a unique record identifier is created that is not derived from an original variable. |
    | Standardized missing values | Selected if the TEST curator standardized missing values for at least half of the variables in the data collection. Standardization of missing values means that all 'missing' responses are coded according to a fixed set of rules. There are various ways in which this standardization is typically applied:  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- In some data collections, each kind of 'missing response' may be assigned the same code across all variables, e.g., 'inapplicable' cases may be coded -1 for all variables, 'don't know' may be coded -2, and 'no answer' may be coded -3.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- In other instances, standards may be specific to the type of variable involved, e.g., blanks may denote missing data for all alphabetic variables, codes -1, -2, and -3 may denote missing data for all dummy variables, and codes 7, 8, and 9 may represent missing data for all other variables.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- In yet other instances, standard codes may depend on the column width of each variable, e.g., 99 may denote 'no answer' for all two column variables and 999 may denote the same for all three column variables. |
