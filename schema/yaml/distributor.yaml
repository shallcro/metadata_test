    Most data collections list ICPSR as the distributor. As such, the  full name and location of ICPSR are easily accessible in the metadata editor.
    
    If a non-ICPSR distributor is necessary, please confirm the standards with the Metadata Librarian. Please note that external distributors are often appropriate for Union Catalog entries and metadata-only releases.
