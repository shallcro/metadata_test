  usageNotes: |
    The Citation is dynamically assembled from other entry elements in this format: Principal-Investigator-list. Study-Title. Distributor-list, Version-Date. DOI. TEST 'union catalog' records – i.e., external resource to which TEST links as a courtesy – do not have citations generated.

    For additional information about how DOIs for citations are generated, see the Digital Object Identifier element usage notes.
