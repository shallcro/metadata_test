    When entering the name of a principal investigator's (PI's) affiliated organization, the following hierarchy of authority control sources should be used to make sure the name conforms to best practices within TEST and the broader academic community:

       1. If the PI has published data with TEST in the past, use the name of the affiliated organization as it has been displayed previously within the TEST catalog.  
       2. If the affiliated organization is in the [TEST Organization Names Authority List](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/TEST/thesaurus/10004), conform to the listed name form.
       3. If the affiliated organization is not available in an TEST authority list, consult [VIAF](https://viaf.org).  
       4. If the affiliated organization does not have a VIAF record, consult another authoritative source, such as the organization's website or Google Scholar.
    
    Additional points regarding the names of organizations:
      
      * If a PI's organizational affiliation is not known, use the term 'Unknown' for the PI affiliation element.
      * If the list of PIs includes multiple people affiliated with the same organization, include the affiliated organization's name for each person.
      * Abbreviations are discouraged, except 'Inc.' and 'Co.' In particular, governmental PI's are spelled out completely (e.g., 'United States Department of Commerce' rather than 'U.S. Dept. of Commerce').
      * 'The' is not included at the start of an organization name unless it is actually part of the official name (e.g., 'The New York Times' but not 'The National Institute of Justice').
