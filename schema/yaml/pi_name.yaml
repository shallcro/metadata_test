    When entering the name of an individual or organizational principal investigator (PI), the following hierarchy of authority control sources should be used to make sure the name conforms to best practices within TEST and the broader academic community:  

      1. If the person or organization has published data with TEST in the past, use the name as it has been displayed previously within the TEST catalog.  
      2. If the person or organization is in the [TEST Personal Name Authority List](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/TEST/thesaurus/10002) or the [TEST Organization Names Authority List](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/TEST/thesaurus/10004), conform to the listed name form.
      3. If the person or organization is not available in an TEST authority list, consult [VIAF](https://viaf.org).  
      4. If the person or organization does not have a VIAF record, consult another authoritative source, such as an organization's website, Google Scholar, or a personal C.V. published on an institutional website.  

    For the names of people: 
      
      * The first name can include any middle names or initials; the Last name can include any suffixes (such as 'II' or 'Jr.'). If a first name includes only an inital, there is no space between first and middle initials.
      * Abbreviations are discouraged (especially 'et al.') but suffixes such as 'Sr.' and 'Jr.' are allowed.  

    For the names of organizations:

      * Include the full hierarchy of the organization, going from the highest level down to the most specific. Note that the higher level of the organization must be listed before the lower level, and levels should be separated by a period (e.g., 'University of Michigan. College of Literature, Science, and the Arts'). There is no period following the last level listed.
      * Abbreviations are discouraged, except 'Inc.' and 'Co.' In particular, governmental PI's are spelled out completely (e.g., 'United States Department of Commerce' rather than 'U.S. Dept. of Commerce').
      * 'The' is not included at the start of an organization name unless it is actually part of the official name (e.g., 'The New York Times' but not 'The National Institute of Justice')
