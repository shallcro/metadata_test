    Local TEST controlled vocabulary. See below for terms and definitions:

    | *Term* | *Definition* |
    |----------|---------------|
    | audio computer-assisted self interview (ACASI) |  Interview administered by the respondent, without an interviewer, assisted by a computer with audio prompts. |
    | audiovisual touch-screen computer-assisted self interview (AVT-CASI) | Interview administered by the respondent, without an interviewer, assisted by a touchscreen computer. |
    | coded on-site observation | Observation that is conducted in a natural environment. |
    | coded video observation | Observation that is conducted by video. |
    | cognitive assessment test | Assessment of knowledge, skills, aptitude, or educational achievement by means of specialized measures or tests. |
    | computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI) | Data collection method in which the interviewer reads questions to the respondents from the screen of a computer, laptop, or a mobile device like tablet or smartphone, and enters the answers in the same device. The administration of the interview is managed by a specifically designed program/application. |
    | computer-assisted self interview (CASI) | Respondents enter the responses into a computer (desktop, laptop, Palm/PDA, tablet, etc.) by themselves. The administration of the questionnaire is managed by a specifically designed program/application but there is no real-time data transfer as in CAWI, the answers are stored on the device used for the interview. The questionnaire may be fixed form or interactive. Includes VCASI (Video computer-assisted self-interviewing), ACASI (Audio computer-assisted self-interviewing) and TACASI (Telephone audio computer-assisted self-interviewing). |
    | computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) | The interviewer asks questions via telephone as directed by a computer, responses are keyed directly into the computer and the administration of the interview is managed by a specifically designed program. |
    | face-to-face interview | Data collection method in which a live interviewer conducts a personal interview, presenting questions and entering the responses. Use this broader term if not CAPI or PAPI, or if not known whether CAPI/PAPI or not. |
    | mail questionnaire | Self-administered survey using a traditional paper questionnaire delivered and/or collected by mail (postal services). |
    | mixed mode | Two or more modes of data collection are employed. |
    | on-site questionnaire | Data collection method in which the information is gathered on-site. |
    | paper and pencil interview (PAPI) | The interviewer uses a traditional paper questionnaire to read the questions and enter the answers. |
    | record abstracts | Presentation of information in a condensed form, by reducing it to its main points. For example, abstracts of interviews or reports that are published and used as data rather than the full-length interviews or reports. |
    | remote sensing | The acquisition of information about an object or phenomenon without making physical contact with the object, especially the Earth. In current usage, the term 'remote sensing' generally refers to the use of satellite- or aircraft-based sensor technologies to detect and classify objects on Earth. |
    | self-enumerated questionnaire | Data collection method in which the respondent reads or listens to the questions, and enters the responses by him/herself; no live interviewer is present, or participates in the questionnaire administration. If possible, use a narrower term. Use this broader term if the method is not described by any of the narrower terms - for example, for PDF and diskette questionnaires. |
    | telephone audio computer-assisted self interview (TACASI) | Interview administered by the respondent, without an interviewer, on the telephone, assisted by a computer. |
    | telephone interview | Interview administered on the telephone. Use this broader term if not CATI, or if not known whether CATI or not. |
    | web-based survey | An interview conducted via the Internet. For example, interviews conducted within online forums or using web-based audio-visual technology that enables the interviewer(s) and interviewee(s) to communicate in real time. |
    | web scraping | A technique employed to extract large amounts of data from websites whereby the data is extracted and saved to a local file or to a database.|
