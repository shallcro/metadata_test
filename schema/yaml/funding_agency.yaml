  usageNotes: |
     When entering the name of a funding agency, the following hierarchy of authority control sources should be used to make sure the name conforms to best practices within TEST and the broader academic community:

       1. If the funding agency has sponsored archived data at TEST, use the name as it has been displayed previously within the TEST catalog.  
       2. If the funding agency is in the [TEST Organization Names Authority List](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/TEST/thesaurus/10004), conform to the listed name form.
       3. If the funding agency is not available in an TEST authority list, consult [VIAF](https://viaf.org).  
       4. If the funding agency does not have a VIAF record, consult another authoritative source, such as the organization's website or Google Scholar.
