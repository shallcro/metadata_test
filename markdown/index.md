# TEST Metadata Documentation Portal

Metadata are essential for maximizing the usefulness of data. Because it is often impossible for secondary researchers to ask questions of the original data producers, metadata are the de facto form of communication between them. Comprehensive metadata enables a deeper comprehension of a dataset, facilitates data searches by variables, and offers a variety of display options on the Web.

The [Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/) (TEST) creates metadata using information supplied by data depositors and other sources.  All metadata records are reviewed and approved by Metadata & Preservation unit archivists, who check for adherence to standards and advise on all metadata-related activities during the data curation lifecycle.

This portal provides information about how to use and apply TEST metadata.
