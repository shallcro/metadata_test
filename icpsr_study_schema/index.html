<h2 id="metadata-elements-detailed-information">Metadata Elements: Detailed Information</h2>
<h3 id="1-version"><a name="version"></a>1. Version</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The current version number for the data collection.</p>
<p><strong>Required</strong>: Yes</p>
<p><strong>Repeatable</strong>: No</p>
<p><strong>Accepted Values</strong>: Number</p>
<p><strong>Controlled Vocabulary:</strong> N/A</p>
<p><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> Version numbers are integers without leading zeros. Versioning begins when a data collection is first archived. Each subsequent update of the data collection increments the version number by 1. The version number is incremented when modifying or adding:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Data files, including additions of datasets or supplemental data files, additional masking, increasing curation level, or resupplied datasets  </li>
<li>Documentation files  </li>
<li>SDA (Survey Documentation and Analysis) files  </li>
</ul>
<p>Metadata-only updates to the data collection do not increment the version number. Changes to the version number require a textual summary to be added to Changes to Collection.  </p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> </p>
<pre><code class="language-json">1
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-json">2

<h3 id="2-version-date"><a name="version_date"></a>2. Version Date</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The date on which the current version of the data collection was released by TEST.</p>
<p><strong>Required</strong>: Yes</p>
<p><strong>Repeatable</strong>: No</p>
<p><strong>Accepted Values</strong>: Text (formatted as a date)</p>
<p><strong>Controlled Vocabulary:</strong> N/A</p>
<p><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> TEST automatically generates this date for data collection additions and updates. For metadata-only updates, the date remains unchanged.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> </p>
<pre><code class="language-json">&quot;2006-03-30&quot;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-json">&quot;2019-05-05&quot;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="3-original-release-date"><a name="original_release_date"></a>3. Original Release Date</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The date on which the data collection was originally released by TEST.</p>
<p><strong>Required</strong>: No</p>
<p><strong>Repeatable</strong>: No</p>
<p><strong>Accepted Values</strong>: Text (formatted as a date)</p>
<p><strong>Controlled Vocabulary:</strong> N/A</p>
<p><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> TEST automatically generates the release date.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> </p>
<pre><code class="language-json">&quot;2001-02-07&quot;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-json">&quot;2020-08-12&quot;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="4-title"><a name="title"></a>4. Title</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The authoritative title of the data collection. A full title should include a descriptive string that captures what the data collection contains as well as the geographic scope of and the time period covered by the data collection.</p>
<p><strong>Required</strong>: Yes</p>
<p><strong>Repeatable</strong>: No</p>
<p><strong>Accepted Values</strong>: Text</p>
<p><strong>Controlled Vocabulary:</strong> N/A</p>
<p><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> The Title includes three essential parts: the title proper, the geography, and the time period.  </p>
<p>Title Proper:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The title proper is a descriptive string that captures what the data collection contains.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The title proper uses title case: all major words are capitalized, while minor words are lowercased.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For new studies, TEST starts with the title proper provided by the data depositor. Most title propers are straightforward about their contents, such as the 'American Community Survey' or the 'Census of Law Enforcement Training Academies.' Some title propers include a more branded description, such as 'Bridge of Faith: Aim4Peace Community-Based Violence Prevention Project or Contents' and 'Contexts of Cyberbullying: An Epidemiologic Study using Electronic Detection and Social Network Analysis.'  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For updated studies, TEST uses the existing title in production, making changes as necessary to add new years or additional geographical locations. For studies that are part of an TEST series, titles remain consistent with the previous series studies.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Geography:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All titles include the data collection's geography. If the geography is already included in the title proper, it is not repeated.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cities are paired with state or province names that are spelled out (e.g., Portland, Oregon), unless the city names are unique or well-known.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Studies with more than four geographic locations typically are summarized using, for example, '5 countries,' '8 German cities,' '20 U.S. states' instead of listing all locations. In the latter case, 'U.S.' is used rather than 'United States' or 'American'.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Descriptors that do not have a distinct geographic area, such as 'communities' or 'regions', are not included in titles.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'Global' may be appropriate for studies where the universe of participants is truly worldwide. Possible examples include online surveys that are not restricted by geography, or studies of organizations, such as NGOs.   </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Time Period:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All titles include the data collection's time period, which reflects the time period that the data collection covers and should match the Time Period. For example, in the 'Uganda Elite Study, 1964-1968', it is assumed that the Ugandans were surveyed about events in 1964-1968, even if the actual data collection might not have taken place until later.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the time period is already included in the title proper, it is not repeated.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For most studies, a single year or range of years is acceptable. Years are written as four digits, including when used in a range (e.g., '1999', '2001-2003', or '1999, 2010, 2015').  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Months are included only when part of TEST series that have multiple releases, which are otherwise identical, each year. In these cases, months are spelled out (e.g., 'September 2020' instead of '9/2020' or 'Sept. 2020').  </p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Controlled Vocabulary:</strong> The <a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/TEST/thesaurus/10002">TEST Personal Names Authority List</a> and <a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/TEST/thesaurus/10004">Organization Names Authority List</a> are the primary authority control sources for PI names. The <a href="https://viaf.org/">Virtual International Authority File</a> (VIAF) serves as a secondary resource if names are not present in TEST lists.</p>
<p><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> When entering the name of an individual or organizational principal investigator (PI), the following hierarchy of authority control sources should be used to make sure the name conforms to best practices within TEST and the broader academic community:    </p>
<ol>
<li>If the person or organization has published data with TEST in the past, use the name as it has been displayed previously within the TEST catalog.    </li>
<li>If the person or organization is in the <a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/TEST/thesaurus/10002">TEST Personal Name Authority List</a> or the <a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/TEST/thesaurus/10004">TEST Organization Names Authority List</a>, conform to the listed name form.  </li>
<li>If the person or organization is not available in an TEST authority list, consult <a href="https://viaf.org">VIAF</a>.    </li>
<li>If the person or organization does not have a VIAF record, consult another authoritative source, such as an organization's website, Google Scholar, or a personal C.V. published on an institutional website.    </li>
</ol>
<p>For the names of people:   </p>
<ul>
<li>The first name can include any middle names or initials; the Last name can include any suffixes (such as 'II' or 'Jr.'). If a first name includes only an inital, there is no space between first and middle initials.  </li>
<li>Abbreviations are discouraged (especially 'et al.') but suffixes such as 'Sr.' and 'Jr.' are allowed.    </li>
</ul>
<p>For the names of organizations:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Include the full hierarchy of the organization, going from the highest level down to the most specific. Note that the higher level of the organization must be listed before the lower level, and levels should be separated by a period (e.g., 'University of Michigan. College of Literature, Science, and the Arts'). There is no period following the last level listed.  </li>
<li>Abbreviations are discouraged, except 'Inc.' and 'Co.' In particular, governmental PI's are spelled out completely (e.g., 'United States Department of Commerce' rather than 'U.S. Dept. of Commerce').  </li>
<li>'The' is not included at the start of an organization name unless it is actually part of the official name (e.g., 'The New York Times' but not 'The National Institute of Justice')  </li>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> The name of the organization that supported the production and/or archiving of the data collection.</p>
<p><strong>Required</strong>: Yes</p>
<p><strong>Repeatable</strong>: No</p>
<p><strong>Accepted Values</strong>: Text</p>
<p><strong>Controlled Vocabulary:</strong> The <a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/TEST/thesaurus/10004">TEST Organization Names Authority List</a> is the primary authority control source for funding agencies. The <a href="https://viaf.org/">Virtual International Authority File</a> (VIAF) serves as a secondary resource if names are not present in the TEST list.</p>
<p><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> When entering the name of a funding agency, the following hierarchy of authority control sources should be used to make sure the name conforms to best practices within TEST and the broader academic community:  </p>
<ol>
<li>If the funding agency has sponsored archived data at TEST, use the name as it has been displayed previously within the TEST catalog.    </li>
<li>If the funding agency is in the <a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/TEST/thesaurus/10004">TEST Organization Names Authority List</a>, conform to the listed name form.  </li>
<li>If the funding agency is not available in an TEST authority list, consult <a href="https://viaf.org">VIAF</a>.    </li>
<li>If the funding agency does not have a VIAF record, consult another authoritative source, such as the organization's website or Google Scholar.  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>TEST Input Guidance:</strong> The Principal Investigator's home institution does not need to be listed as a funding agency unless the PI provides a grant number (or other award information) or makes a specific request.</p>

<h3 id="14-summary"><a name="summary"></a>14. Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> A full description or abstract of the data collection's subject matter or intellectual content. The main goal of the Summary is to give the user a clear sense of what the collection is about, including the purpose of the collection, the major topics covered, and what questions the principal investigators attempted to answer when they conducted the data collection.</p>
<p><strong>Required</strong>: Yes</p>
<p><strong>Repeatable</strong>: No</p>
<p><strong>Accepted Values</strong>: Text</p>
<p><strong>Controlled Vocabulary:</strong> N/A</p>
<p><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> The main goal of the Summary is to give the reader a clear sense of what the data collection is about, including substantive information about the different parts of the data collection not adequately conveyed by the Fileset names or found elsewhere in the metadata.   </p>
<p>A listing of major variables or categories of variables with a few examples is also important. It is also salient to indicate the unit of analysis for the data collection, i.e., who or what is being studied: individuals, housing units, courts, criminal acts, etc. Most often the unit of analysis is the individual; where it is not, it is particularly important to make this clear.  </p>
<p>The Summary is written in the third person and avoids attempting to address issues of how the data might be used, who might be interested in the data, or any evaluative comments about the worth or usefulness of the data collection. The Summary uses past tense when describing the process of collecting the data and present tense when necessary, such as when describing the data (e.g., 'The MIDUS Refresher collection is split into two datasets.'). Numerals are used instead of spelling them out; if a number is spelled out for emphasis, the number is attached in parentheses (e.g. 'Two thousand (2,000)').  </p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> </p>
<pre><code class="language-json">&quot;In 2014, Chicago Public Schools, looking to reduce the possibility of gun violence among school-aged youth, applied for a grant through the National Institute of Justice. CPS was awarded the Comprehensive School Safety Initiative grant and use said grant to establish the 'Connect and Redirect to Respect' program. This program used student social media data to identify and intervene with students thought to be at higher risk for committing violence. At-risk behaviors included brandishing a weapon, instigating conflict online, signaling gang involvement, and threats towards others. Identified at-risk students would be contacted by a member of the CPS Network Safety Team or the Chicago Police Department's Gang School Safety Team, depending on the risk level of the behavior. To evaluate the efficacy of CRR, the University of Chicago Crime Lab compared outcomes for students enrolled in schools that received the program to outcomes for students enrolled in comparison schools, which did not receive the program. 32 schools were selected for the study, with a total of 44,503 students. Demographic variables included age, race, sex, and ethnicity. Misconduct and academic variables included arrest history, in-school suspensions, out-of-school suspensions, GPA, and attendance days.&quot;

<pre><code class="language-json">&quot;The Health and Relationship Project is a study of both spouses in same-sex and different-sex marriages who were legally married and aged 35 to 65 at the time of data collection (2015). There are two parts of this study: a baseline questionnaire and a daily diary questionnaire completed for 10 consecutive days; both components were completed online and spouses were asked to complete the surveys separately. The baseline questionnaire asks participants about a number of topics related to marriage and health, including stress, health status and health behaviors, relationship quality, and how they have approached health problems in the past. The diary questionnaire asks participants a number of questions about the past 24 hours, including daily stress experiences, social interactions, and health behaviors.&quot;

<h3 id="15-subject-term"><a name="subject_term"></a>15. Subject Term</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> A controlled list of terms used for indexing purposes to indicate what topics a data collection reflects. Subject Terms serve to increase the collection's discoverability by topic.</p>
<p><strong>Required</strong>: Yes</p>
<p><strong>Repeatable</strong>: Yes</p>
<p><strong>Accepted Values</strong>: Text</p>
<p><strong>Controlled Vocabulary:</strong> The <a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/TEST/thesaurus/10001">TEST Subject Thesaurus</a> and the <a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/TEST/thesaurus/10002">TEST Personal Names Authority List</a> are preferred sources.</p>
<p><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> The <a href="https://authorities.loc.gov">Library of Congress Subject Terms</a> is referenced when adding new terms to the TEST Subject Thesaurus.</p>
<p><strong>TEST Input Guidance:</strong> Non-thesaurus terms can be submitted in the metadata editor and will be reviewed by the metadata librarian. If an TEST staff member submits a non-thesaurus term, the metadata librarian will gauge the necessity of this term, check it against the Library of Congress Subject Headings to see if a different related term should be used, and consider it for addition to the TEST thesaurus.</p>

Each geographic term's full hierarchy must be included; please note:   </p>
<ul>
<li>For a U.S. city, the state and country are listed alongside (e.g., 'Los Angeles, California, United States').   </li>
<li>Non-U.S. geographic subdivisions need not include hierarchical relations, with the specific exceptions of Canadian provinces and the countries within the United Kingdom.  </li>
<li>'Global' may be appropriate for studies where the universe of participants is truly worldwide. Possible examples include online surveys that are not restricted by geography, or studies of organizations, such as NGOs.  </li>
<li>County-level information is typically not indicated. If a U.S. county will be included, the state name and 'United States' must be listed as well.  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Required</strong>: No</p>
<p><strong>Repeatable</strong>: No</p>
<p><strong>Accepted Values</strong>: Text</p>
<p><strong>Controlled Vocabulary:</strong> N/A</p>
<p><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> The Study Purpose provides more specific information than the Summary element, including the data collection's objectives, intended achievements, and lists of questions it sought to answer. This element can also include historical or background information about the research project. As with the Summary, the text should be written in third person and avoid any commentary on the data collection's outcomes.</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">&quot;The purpose of the study was to explore the impact of interventions by Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners/Sexual Assault Response Teams (SANE/SART) on the judicial process. The goal of this study was to test the efficacy of SANE/SART programs as a tool in the criminal justice system. The American Prosecutors Research Institute and Boston College tested the hypotheses that SANE/SART exams increase arrest and prosecution rates. In testing this hypothesis, the project team sought to answer five primary research questions: (1) Is the arrest rate higher in cases where a SANE/SART exam is performed as compared with cases in which no exam is performed?, (2) Is the indictment/charging rate higher in such cases?, (3) Are guilty pleas more likely to be entered in such cases, and are pleas likely to be to the existing charge or to a lesser charge?, (4) Is the conviction rate higher in such cases?, and (5) Is the sentence more severe in such cases? In addition, the project team examined the participation of victims in the criminal justice process and the types of services that were offered them. As a large portion of SANE/SART programs focus on understanding victims' reactions to sexual assault and ensuring proper treatment to minimize the chance of further trauma, a central hypothesis to be tested was that improved case outcomes may be a result of increased participation by the victim in the identification, apprehension, and prosecution of the perpetrator. Moreover, the level of services offered and provided to victims, particularly those related to prosecution would likely affect case outcomes as well. Both the victim's participation in the criminal justice system and specifics of SANE/SART services, including evidence collection, were considered in determining the true impact of SANE/SART interventions on case outcomes.&quot;

<p><strong>Example:</strong> </p>
<pre><code class="language-json">&quot;Data on organizational culture in each of the 12 courts (Part 1) were obtained by administering the Court Culture Assessment Instrument (CCAI) to all judges with a felony criminal court docket and to all senior court administrators. A total of 224 respondents completed the questionnaire. The CCAI was used to assess five key dimensions of current court culture orientation: (1) dominant case management style, (2) judicial and court staff relations, (3) change management, (4) courthouse leadership, and (5) internal organization. The determination of what culture judges and court administrators desired to establish in the near future was also obtained through the application of the same instrument (CACI) as practitioners were asked to indicate the type of culture in each work area (or content dimension) they would like to see in their court in the next five years. Additionally, surveys were conducted of prosecuting attorneys (Part 2) and public defender attorneys (Part 3) to gauge their views on how well the courts in which they practice achieve the goals of access, fairness, and managerial effectiveness. Every prosecutor and public defender with two years or more experience in representing the state or criminal defendants in felony cases was asked to complete a questionnaire probing their thoughts on how well their court acted to promote access to records through availability and staff cooperation, treating litigants, witnesses, jurors and others fairly, and demonstrating concern for the rights and interests of others in the criminal trial process, including attorney and victims. A total of 334 prosecuting attorneys and 260 public defense attorneys completed the 46-item trial court process survey.&quot;

    &quot;The original National Longitudinal Survey of Youth Children and Young Adults 1979 (NLSY79) was a multi-stage, stratified random national sample. Sampling weights are available in the public-use datasets to adjust for minority oversamples and year-to-year attrition. There are mother and child specific weights. Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) were counties and independent cities. PSUs were stratified prior to sampling based on 9 Census divisions and 2 urban/rural classes.&quot;,
    &quot;The initial Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) combined two independent samples: a cross-sectional, national sample (based on stratified multistage selection of the civilian noninstitutional population of the U.S.) and a national sample of low-income families. The cross-section sample was an equal probability sample of households in the 48 coterminous states designed to yield about 3,000 completed interviews. The second sample was selected from the Census Bureau's Survey of Economic Opportunity (SEO) using unequal selection probabilities. &quot;

<p><strong>Required</strong>: No</p>
<p><strong>Repeatable</strong>: No</p>
<p><strong>Accepted Values</strong>: Text</p>
<p><strong>Controlled Vocabulary:</strong> N/A</p>
<p><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> The inclusion of a common scale should be identified in the documentation associated with this dataset and confirmed by variable names or labels. The scales can be cited either as a list or described in full sentences. If the questionnaire used has a finite list of responses (e.g., 'Always, Sometimes, Rarely, Never' or Strongly Agree, Agree, Disagree, Strongly Disagree'), it is acceptable for this element to note 'A Likert-type scale was used,' or 'Several Likert-type scales were used.' However, it is not required to note Likart-type scales in situations where only such scales were used, given their ubiquity.  </p>
<p><strong>TEST Input Guidance:</strong> For National Institute of Justice (NIJ) studies, if there is no indication that scales are used, enter 'None' in this element. For all other archives, this element is optional.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> </p>
<pre><code class="language-json">[
    &quot;The baseline data collection included one scale - the CES-D index for maternal depression [Cole, J. C., Rabin, A. S., Smith, T. L., and Kaufman, A. S. (2004).

<h3 id="33-unit-of-observation"><a name="unit_of_observation"></a>33. Unit of Observation</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Describes the entity being analyzed in the data collection; otherwise known as analysis unit.</p>
<p><strong>Required</strong>: No</p>
<p><strong>Repeatable</strong>: Yes</p>
<p><strong>Accepted Values</strong>: Text</p>
<p><strong>Controlled Vocabulary:</strong> N/A</p>
<p><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> Use a brief phrase, for example: 'Individual,' 'Family,' 'Household,' or 'Organization'; when possible, conform to the <a href="https://vocabularies.cessda.eu/vocabulary/AnalysisUnit?v=2.1.3&amp;lang=en">DDI Controlled Vocabulary for Analysis Unit</a>.</p>

<h3 id="34-smallest-geographic-unit"><a name="smallest_geographic_unit"></a>34. Smallest Geographic Unit</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The smallest geographic unit used in the dataset.</p>
<p><strong>Required</strong>: No</p>
<p><strong>Repeatable</strong>: No</p>
<p><strong>Accepted Values</strong>: Text</p>
<p><strong>Controlled Vocabulary:</strong> N/A</p>
<p><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> Geographic Unit is intended to represent specific, known geography -- e.g., county, census district, FIPS code, electoral district, and any other conveyor of specific geography that is represented by a variable.  </p>
<p>If the data do not include a geographic variable by which the data can be analyzed, this element is not indicated. If all the cases are from a single state, but the cases are not subdivided geographically within that state, then 'state' is not indicated.  </p>
<p>This element is only meant to convey specific, known, geography. If there is a variable indicating which testing site a survey was taken at, but the locations of the testing sites were masked by the PI, this element is likely not indicated.</p>
<p><strong>TEST Input Guidance:</strong> For National Institute of Justice (NIJ) studies, enter 'None' if no geographic variables are present. For all other archives, this element is optional.</p>

<p><strong>Required</strong>: No</p>
<p><strong>Repeatable</strong>: No</p>
<p><strong>Accepted Values</strong>: Text</p>
<p><strong>Controlled Vocabulary:</strong> N/A</p>
<p><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> Restrictions informs users that access to certain variables in a collection may be limited, and that they should contact TEST directly to inquire about accessing them.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> </p>
<pre><code class="language-json">&quot;These data may not be used for any purpose other than statistical reporting and analysis. Use of these data to learn the identity of any person or establishment is strictly prohibited. To protect respondent privacy, certain files within this data collection are restricted from general dissemination.

<h3 id="38-classification"><a name="classification"></a>38. Classification</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> TEST classifications address topics broadly, and are meant to be a good starting point for exploring the collection.</p>
<p><strong>Required</strong>: No</p>
<p><strong>Repeatable</strong>: Yes</p>
<p><strong>Accepted Values</strong>: Text</p>
<p><strong>Controlled Vocabulary:</strong> <a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/TEST/access/subject.html">TEST Topic Classifications</a></p>
<p><strong>TEST Input Guidance:</strong> When there are multiple subclassifications, the smallest (most detailed) one is chosen to represent the data collection. Each data collection must have at least one TEST classification, as well as a classification from the collection's home archive. Classifications can also be used to cross-list a study among multiple archives. Curators should choose the topical classifications that best match the study's focus.</p>

<h3 id="39-filesets"><a name="filesets"></a>39. Filesets</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong>  Identifies the grouping of files in a data collection. Every TEST data collection with at least one file must have at least one defined Fileset.</p>
<p><strong>Required</strong>: No</p>
<p><strong>Repeatable</strong>: Yes</p>
<p><strong>Accepted Values</strong>: Multi-part element; see subfield definitions for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Controlled Vocabulary:</strong> N/A</p>
<p><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> Filesets are used at TEST to make a convenient package for description, discovery, preservation and dissemination -- a package that is smaller than the data collection but larger than the individual file. A fileset typically contains a single file of statistical data plus additional files that support the data -- such as setups for statistical software, documentation, and alternative data representations. A data collection may have multiple filesets. Each Fileset has a Number, and may also have a Name and an SDA (Survey Documentation and Analysis) Note.</p>

<h5 id="3911-number"><a name="filesets_items_number"></a>39.1.1. Number</h5>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> A number that uniquely identifies a 'part' or component file that is associated with the data collection.</p>
<p><strong>Required</strong>: Yes</p>
<p><strong>Repeatable</strong>: No</p>
<p><strong>Accepted Values</strong>: Number</p>
<p><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> Fileset numbers are typically (but not always) consecutive integers beginning with 1. (In some cases, the number may be drawn from an external resource, such as FIPS state and county codes.) The numbers correspond to the 'part numbers' embedded in TEST standard filenames.</p>

<p><strong>Repeatable</strong>: No</p>
<p><strong>Accepted Values</strong>: Text</p>
<p><strong>Controlled Vocabulary:</strong> N/A</p>
<p><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> Fileset Names are required for data collections that include multiple Filesets. If a data collection includes only one fileset, a Fileset Name is not included. Fileset Names use title case (all main words are capitalized) and do not begin with articles (a, the) or dates.</p>
